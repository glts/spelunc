A Gorilla REPL worksheet being a showcase of Gorilla REPL with Huri using
Clojure spec generators as the subject under study.

## Important

*   At the time of writing the latest release of **Gorilla REPL does not support
    Clojure 1.9!** I had to build my own snapshot, and so will you if you want
    to run this worksheet (see the Gorilla REPL issue tracker for instructions).

*   **Huri requires an R installation.** Plots are generated via R.
